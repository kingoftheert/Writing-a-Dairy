_Future improvement:

+ Do not change the encryption type; it must remain simple enough to be decrypted by hand within 10 minutes.

+ Built-in AI voice recognition must be used with your own hardware.

+ Story compiler from your diary.
  
+ Multilingual Support.

+ User Authentication.

+ Mobile Support.

+ Customizable Interface.

+ Accessibility Features. (Add features like screen readers or high-contrast modes to make the tool more accessible to users with disabilities.)
